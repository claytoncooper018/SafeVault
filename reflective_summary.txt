Vulnerabilities identified:
- Input that could allow stored XSS via unvalidated fields.
- Plain-text password storage in demo (not production-ready).
- Missing role restrictions on some endpoints (fixed).

Fixes applied:
- DTO validation checks to reject suspicious input and require fields.
- Added JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization for admin endpoints.
- Security headers middleware to reduce XSS/clickjacking risk.
- Tests that validate authentication and DTO validation behaviors.

Copilot assistance:
- Copilot helped scaffold DTO validation and middleware patterns, suggested default tests, and provided JWT authentication examples which were adapted for this educational demo.
